## Wiki Search

Wiki Search is a front-end application that utilizes the Wikipedia API to retrieve data based on user search inputs. This mini project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce Next.js concepts and implement best practices.

The application provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to enter their search queries. Upon submitting a query, the application fetches relevant data from Wikipedia using the provided API. Users can then explore the retrieved information and gain insights on their desired topics.

By building this project, I aim to strengthen my understanding of Next.js and enhance my proficiency in developing web applications. Through the utilization of industry best practices, I strive to deliver a high-quality and efficient solution.

I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions to improve the Wiki Search application. Let's collaborate and create a powerful tool for accessing information through the Wikipedia API.

Happy searching!
