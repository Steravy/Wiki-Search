## Wiki Search

Wiki Search is a front-end application that utilizes the Wikipedia API to retrieve data based on user search inputs. This mini project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce Next.js concepts and implement best practices.

The application provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to enter their search queries. Upon submitting a query, the application fetches relevant data from Wikipedia using the provided API. Users can then explore the retrieved information and gain insights on their desired topics.

By building this project, we aim to strengthen our understanding of Next.js and enhance our proficiency in developing web applications. Through the utilization of industry best practices, we strive to deliver a high-quality and efficient solution.

We welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions to improve the Wiki Search application. Let's collaborate and create a powerful tool for accessing information through the Wikipedia API.

Happy searching!
